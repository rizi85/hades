# Clone Phishing

## Description

Clone Phishing involves attackers creating a nearly identical replica of a legitimate email, complete with malicious links or attachments, which is then sent from an address resembling the original senderâ€™s. This technique leverages the recipient's trust in previous communications to deceive them into compromising their security.

## Steps to identify

1. Inspect the sender's email address closely for subtle changes or discrepancies.
2. Be cautious of emails that seem to be repeats or updates of previously received messages, especially if they include links or attachments.
3. Verify any suspicious or unexpected email directly with the sender through a separate communication channel.
