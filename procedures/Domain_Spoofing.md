# Domain Spoofing

## Description

Domain Spoofing involves creating misleading domain names that appear similar to legitimate ones, used in phishing attacks to deceive users into thinking they're visiting an official website. It's a tactic used alongside website spoofing in brand hijacking attacks.

## Steps to identify

1. Pay close attention to the URL for any minor discrepancies from the legitimate domain.
2. Use trusted services to verify the authenticity of a website before providing any sensitive information.
3. Be aware of the context in which you're directed to a website; legitimate companies typically do not ask for sensitive information via unsolicited communications.
