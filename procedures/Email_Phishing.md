# Email Phishing

## Description

Email Phishing involves sending fraudulent emails that appear to come from reputable sources. The goal is to trick recipients into revealing personal information or downloading malware.

## Steps to identify

1. Look out for generic greetings and urgent or threatening language that pressures immediate action.
2. Examine the sender's email address for slight discrepancies from the legitimate source's address.
3. Be cautious with links and attachments, especially if the email asks for personal information or to confirm account details.
