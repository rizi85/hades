# Evil Twin Phishing

## Description

Evil Twin Phishing involves attackers setting up a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate one. Victims connect to this Wi-Fi, mistaking it for a genuine network, allowing attackers to spy on internet activities and steal sensitive information such as login credentials and financial data. These attacks are especially dangerous because they don't leave obvious signs, making them difficult to detect.

## Steps to identify

1. Be cautious of Wi-Fi networks that appear unsecured or have duplicate names similar to legitimate networks, as these could be evil twin networks.
2. Pay attention to suspicious captive portal pages that ask for personal information or appear poorly designed with typos and grammatical errors.
3. Utilize VPN services when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your data and reduce the risk of falling victim to such attacks.
