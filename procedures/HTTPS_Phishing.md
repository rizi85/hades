# HTTPS Phishing

## Description

HTTPS Phishing attacks exploit the trust users have in secure connections symbolized by HTTPS in the URL and the padlock icon in the browser. Attackers create fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate ones to steal sensitive information.

## Steps to identify

1. Closely examine the URL in the address bar for misspellings or odd characters, even when the site uses HTTPS.
2. Be wary of any unsolicited requests for personal information or actions that seem out of character for the supposed sender.
3. Use browser security features or extensions that help identify fraudulent websites.
