# Image Phishing

## Description

Image Phishing involves using images or graphics to deceive individuals into believing they are interacting with a legitimate website or email. These images can be used in various phishing campaigns to mimic logos, buttons, or even entire webpages of well-known companies. The tactic exploits the visual recognition of reputable brands to trick users into disclosing personal, financial, or login information.

## Steps to identify

1. Examine the context in which an image is used. Be wary if an image, such as a login button or a security badge, prompts you for immediate action or personal information.
2. Check the URL of the page you're on, especially if you arrived there by clicking on an image. Ensure it matches the legitimate website's URL.
3. Be cautious of images in emails that ask you to click on them for more information, especially if the email asks for sensitive information or to verify your account details.
