# Pharming

## Description

Pharming redirects users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones to steal sensitive information. This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the DNS system or by infecting a user's computer with malware.

## Steps to identify

1. Check for SSL certificates and HTTPS in the URL on websites where sensitive information is entered.
2. Be wary of websites that look different or have unexpected behaviors.
3. Use reputable antivirus and security software to detect and prevent pharming attacks.
