# Search Engine Phishing

## Description

Search Engine Phishing, or SEO poisoning, involves cybercriminals using search engine optimization (SEO) tactics to make their fraudulent websites appear at the top of search engine results. This tricks users into visiting spoofed websites that mimic legitimate ones, aiming to steal personal information or credentials.

## Steps to identify

1. Look out for random pop-ups, device overheating, or unusual slowness, which may indicate you're on a spoofed site.
2. Check for misspellings, grammatical errors, or unusual URLs that could signal the site's illegitimacy.
3. Always double-check the URL before clicking on a search result to ensure it matches the expected site, particularly for sites involving financial transactions or personal data input.
