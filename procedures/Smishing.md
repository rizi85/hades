# Smishing

## Description

Smishing is a form of phishing conducted via SMS text messages. Attackers send fraudulent messages trying to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information by posing as a legitimate institution or company.

## Steps to identify

1. Be cautious of text messages that create a sense of urgency or fear, asking for personal or financial information.
2. Verify the legitimacy of any request by contacting the company through official channels, not through the contact details provided in the message.
3. Look out for messages with links; avoid clicking on them before verifying the sender's identity.
