# Social Engineering

## Description

Social Engineering is a broad term encompassing various manipulative techniques aiming to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. It exploits human psychology rather than relying on technical hacking techniques, making it a formidable and common attack method.

## Steps to identify

1. Be wary of unsolicited communications asking for sensitive information, even if they appear to come from a legitimate source.
2. Watch for urgency or fear-inducing messages, pressuring you to act quickly without verification.
3. Verify the identity of the person or organization contacting you through independent means before providing any information or taking action.
