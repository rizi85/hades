# Spear Phishing

## Description

Spear phishing is an advanced form of phishing that targets specific individuals or organizations. Unlike broader phishing campaigns, it involves gathering detailed information about the target to make fraudulent communication (such as an email) more convincing.

## Steps to identify

1. Verify unexpected requests for sensitive information, even if they appear to come from known contacts.
2. Check for slight abnormalities in the sender's email address, which may indicate impersonation.
3. Be cautious of links and attachments, even when they seem to come from trusted sources. Hover over links to preview the URL without clicking.
