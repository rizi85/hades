# Website Spoofing

## Description

Website Spoofing involves creating fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate ones, aiming to steal personal information from visitors. These fake sites often register domain names similar to the ones they're impersonating and can range from crude copies to sophisticated replicas of the original site.

## Steps to identify

1. Examine the URL for subtle differences from the legitimate site's address.
2. Look for SSL certificates and the secure padlock icon next to the URL; however, be aware that an SSL certificate alone doesn't guarantee legitimacy.
3. Double-check domain details against the SSL certificate and look for discrepancies.
