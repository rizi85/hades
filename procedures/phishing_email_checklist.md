# Sender's Email Address

1. Check if the sender's email address seems legitimate or if it's trying to impersonate a well-known company or organization.
2. Look for small variations in the email address, such as an extra letter or a misspelling.
3. Check if the domain name of the email address matches the company's official domain.

# Email Subject Line

1. Look for urgency or scare tactics in the subject line, such as "Your account has been compromised" or "Immediate action required."
2. Check if the subject line is too generic or vague, which could be an attempt to entice you to open the email.
3. Be cautious of subject lines that promise something too good to be true, like free gifts or prizes.

# Email Content

1. Look for grammar and spelling mistakes, which can be an indication of a phishing attempt.
2. Check for inconsistencies in the writing style or tone within the email.
3. Be wary of emails that ask for personal or financial information, such as login credentials or credit card numbers.
4. Verify if the email includes a legitimate reason for requesting sensitive information.

# Links and Attachments

1. Hover over any links within the email to see the actual URL before clicking on them.
2. Check if the URL looks suspicious or doesn't match the expected domain of the company.
3. Be cautious of shortened URLs or URLs that use redirects, as they can mask the true destination.
4. Scan any attachments with an up-to-date antivirus software before opening them.
5. Be skeptical of unexpected attachments, especially if they have unusual file extensions.

# Email Headers

1. View the full email headers to see the complete path of the email.
2. Check if the email originated from a trusted source by analyzing the "Received" lines in the headers.
3. Look for discrepancies between the "From" address and the actual sender's email address in the headers.

# Company Policies and Procedures

1. Verify if the email follows the company's standard communication practices and policies.
2. Check if the request or action mentioned in the email aligns with the company's procedures.
3. Reach out to the company directly through their official channels if you have any doubts about the email's legitimacy.

# Gut Feeling and Common Sense

1. Trust your instincts if something seems off or too good to be true.
2. Apply common sense and critical thinking when evaluating the email's content and requests.
3. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and report the suspicious email to the appropriate authorities or security team.
