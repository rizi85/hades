# Spear Phishing
## Description
Spear phishing is a type of targeted phishing attack that is highly personalized and carefully crafted to trick specific individuals or organizations. The attackers gather information about their targets through various means, such as social engineering, public data sources, or compromised databases. They then create believable phishing emails, websites, or other forms of communication that appear to be from a trusted source, making it more likely for the target to fall for the scam.

## Steps to identify
- Look for personalized details or references in the communication that may have been gleaned from online profiles or internal sources
- Be wary of emails or messages that create a sense of urgency or pressure to take immediate action
- Verify the authenticity of the sender's email address or website URL
- Check for spelling or grammatical errors, which can be a red flag for a phishing attempt
- Be cautious of unsolicited requests for sensitive information or login credentials

# HTTPS Phishing
## Description
HTTPS phishing involves attackers creating a phishing website that uses a valid HTTPS certificate, making it appear more legitimate and trustworthy to potential victims. This technique exploits the common belief that HTTPS websites are inherently safe and secure. However, the HTTPS certificate only ensures that the connection between the user and the website is encrypted, not that the website itself is genuine or safe.

## Steps to identify
- Carefully inspect the website URL for any unusual or suspicious elements
- Check if the domain name matches the organization or service it claims to represent
- Look for visual cues or design elements that seem out of place or inconsistent with the legitimate website
- Be cautious of unexpected or unsolicited requests for sensitive information, even on a website with a valid HTTPS certificate
